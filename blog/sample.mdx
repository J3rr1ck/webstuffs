# Welcome to the Sample Blog Post

This is a sample blog post written in MDX. MDX allows you to write JSX within markdown, making it a powerful tool for creating interactive content.

## Why Use MDX?

MDX combines the simplicity of markdown with the power of React components. This means you can:

- Write markdown as usual
- Embed React components directly within your markdown

## Example Component

Here's an example of a React component embedded within this MDX file:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

<Counter />
```

## Conclusion

MDX is a great way to create rich, interactive content using the power of React and the simplicity of markdown. Give it a try in your next project!
